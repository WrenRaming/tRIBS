This is the tRIBS model version 3.1 Revision 1, April 2020


This version compiles with latest g++ in:
*  Linux (make -f makeLINUX all) and  
*  MAC (make -f makeMAC all)
*  AGAVE (make -f makeAGAVE_PAR all)

(Other Parallel versions have not been tested yet)

Some minor bugs were fixed to compile in newer versions of g++
