# TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator
 The TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS, version 4.0) is a fully distributed physical based hydrological model. Details about the running the model and its applications can be found [here](https://tribshms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
## Installation and Compilation
tRIBS is an object-oriented based code written in c++. In order to run tRIBS you must download and compile the source code from this GitHub repository. tRIBS V4 has been updated with a CMake build system and has been updated to currently run on new (2022-2023) Mac and Linux OS with C++ standard 17.
Instructions for using CMake can be found [here.](./md/CMake.md)
## Examples 
Benchmark examples of tRIBS simulations can be found at the following repositories: [Happy Jack](https://github.com/tribshms/HJ_BenchMark) and [South Parker Fork](...).
