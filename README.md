# TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator: Version 5.2
This repository contains source code for the fully distributed hydrological model: TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS). We provide extensive documention of the model [here](https://tribshms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Our documentation also contains useful information about working with the tRIBS code base through [GitHub](file:///Users/lraming/Documents/Repos/Forked/rtdocs/docs/_build/html/man/Using%20GitHub.html) and how to [contribute](file:///Users/lraming/Documents/Repos/Forked/rtdocs/docs/_build/html/man/Contributing.html). Finally we also provide [templates](file:///Users/lraming/Documents/Repos/Forked/rtdocs/docs/_build/html/man/Executables.html) and [benchmarks](file:///Users/lraming/Documents/Repos/Forked/rtdocs/docs/_build/html/man/Benchmarks.html) with instruction on how to utilize these resources in the documentation.
