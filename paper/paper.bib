	abstract = {The temporal evolution of spatial hydrologic patterns in systems with strong seasonality in water availability is poorly understood. In this study, we use a distributed hydrologic model to explore the switching between local (vegetative) and nonlocal (topographic) factors in a semiarid ponderosa pine hillslope. Our modeling effort is focused on identifying threshold behavior in the hillslope response due to wetting during the North American monsoon (NAM). We calibrate the model to distributed surface soil moisture data for one summer and then test the model against a broader range of observations over multiple seasons. Model simulations are then used to identify vegetation and topographic controls on spatial patterns in soil moisture and runoff generation. Vegetation patterns primarily influence the hydrologic response during dry summer periods leading to patchiness related to the ponderosa pine stands. The spatial response switches to fine-scale terrain curvature controls during persistently wet NAM periods. Thus, a climatic threshold involving rainfall and weather conditions during the NAM is identified in the hillslope response when sufficient lateral soil moisture fluxes are activated by high rainfall amounts and the lower evapotranspiration induced by cloud cover. The spatial variability of hillslope soil moisture and runoff generation also increases due to the crossing of this threshold in the seasonal rainfall distribution. Our findings point to the influence of topography and lateral fluxes during summer periods of high wetness in forested hillslopes of the southwestern United States.},

	abstract = {The effects of radiation scattering and sheltering on snow distributions are poorly understood in montane regions of the southwestern United States. To examine this, we develop a single-layer, distributed snow model (DSM) that includes canopy interception, and radiation scattering and sheltering. In our simulations, we distinguish between local and remote controls on shortwave radiation. This allows us to vary the representation of the effective albedo of the surrounding terrain from a vegetated to a snow-covered landscape and examine the impact this has on snow accumulation and melt. The distributed model is applied to La Jara catchment in the Valles Caldera, New Mexico, during the 2004–2005 winter season. Results indicate that a landscape-scale albedo controlled by vegetation has little effect on local scale-processes, such as incoming shortwave radiation and maximum snow water equivalent (SWE). This implies that increases from scattered light are nearly equal to the losses of radiation from remote sheltering. In contrast, when landscape-scale albedo is controlled by snow cover or by a proposed dynamic method accounting for snow in the vegetation canopy, there are large deviations in the spatiotemporal distributions of shortwave radiation and SWE due to scattered radiation exceeding the sheltering effects of remote topography. Our study results indicate that remote interactions of radiation, vegetation and topography are critical to consider in snow ecohydrological studies in regions with high solar flux and rugged topography.

The TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS) is calibrated and verified for the Baron Fork at Eldon, Illinois River at Watts, and Blue River at Blue over the period 1993–2000. Computational effort is significantly reduced by simulating complex watersheds using a multiple resolution mesh to represent terrain. Model performance is assessed by comparing streamflow predictions to observations at the basin outlet and interior gauging stations. In addition, simulation results describing the distributed basin response to atmospheric forcing are discussed, including the spatial and temporal variability of runoff, surface soil moisture, evaporative flux, and groundwater table position. By modeling the land-surface water and energy states and fluxes over the computational domain in an efficient manner, the potential for utilizing fully-distributed models at the scales of operational hydrologic forecasting is realized. Through the spatially-explicit approach, high-resolution remote sensing data describing surface properties, topography, rainfall, and soil moisture can be integrated directly into a predictive hydrologic model. A greater degree of physical interpretation of hydrological estimation can thus be added to existing methods of operational forecasting.},

The framework provides an efficient method for storing, accessing, and updating a Delaunay triangulation and its associated Voronoi diagram. The basic data structure consists of three interconnected data objects: triangles, nodes, and directed edges. Encapsulating each of these geometric elements within a data object makes it possible to essentially decouple the TIN representation from the modeling applications that make use of it. Both the triangulation and its corresponding Voronoi diagram can be rapidly retrieved or updated, making these methods well suited to adaptive remeshing schemes. We develop a set of algorithms for defining drainage networks and identifying closed depressions (e.g., lakes) for hydrologic and geomorphic modeling applications. We also outline simple numerical algorithms for solving network routing and 2D transport equations within the TIN framework. The methods are illustrated with two example applications, a landscape evolution model and a distributed rainfall-runoff model.},

A new physics-based, distributed-parameter hydrological model that uses an irregular spatial discretization is introduced. The model accounts, on a continuous basis, for the processes of rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, moisture dynamics in the unsaturated and saturated zones, and runoff routing. Simulations of several mid- to large-sized watersheds (∼103 km2) highlight various dynamic relationships between the vadose zone–groundwater processes and their dependence on the land surface characteristics. It is argued that the model inferences can be used for interpretation of distributed relationships in a catchment. By exploiting a multiple-resolution representation, the hydrologic features of the watershed terrain are captured with only 5–10\% of the original grid nodes. This computational efficiency suggests the feasibility of the operational use of fully distributed, physics-based models for large watersheds.},

	abstract = {Process-based hydrological models have a long history dating back to the 1960s. Criticized by some as over-parameterized, overly complex, and difficult to use, a more nuanced view is that these tools are necessary in many situations and, in a certain class of problems, they are the most appropriate type of hydrological model. This is especially the case in situations where knowledge of flow paths or distributed state variables and/or preservation of physical constraints is important. Examples of this include: spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture, groundwater flow and runoff generation, sediment and contaminant transport, or when feedbacks among various Earth’s system processes or understanding the impacts of climate non-stationarity are of primary concern. These are situations where process-based models excel and other models are unverifiable. This article presents this pragmatic view in the context of existing literature to justify the approach where applicable and necessary. We review how improvements in data availability, computational resources and algorithms have made detailed hydrological simulations a reality. Avenues for the future of process-based hydrological models are presented suggesting their use as virtual laboratories, for design purposes, and with a powerful treatment of uncertainty.},

	abstract = {The application of physics-based distributed hydrologic models (DHMs) at hyperresolutions ( 100 m) is expected to support several water-related applications but is still prevented by critical data, model validation, and computational challenges. In this study, we address some of these challenges by applying the TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator DHM at a nominal resolution of 88 m in the Río Sonora basin, a regional watershed of 21,000 km2 in northwest Mexico. First, we generate reliable high-resolution (1-km) hydrometeorological forcings by bias correcting reanalysis products with ground observations and applying downscaling routines that use terrain information at high resolution, which is available globally. Second, we develop a strategy to obtain high-resolution (250-m) grids of soil parameters by integrating a coarse-resolution soil map based on the Food and Agriculture Organization classification with recently released high-resolution global data sets. Third, we apply the model over a decadal period (2004–2013) and use a set of complementary tools, including Taylor diagrams, connectivity analysis, and empirical orthogonal function analysis, to assess its ability to simulate spatial patterns of land surface temperature through comparison with daily remotely sensed products. We find that (i) the hyperresolution-simulated patterns capture the spatial variability of land surface temperature quite well and (ii) vegetation properties are the major physical factors controlling the discrepancies between simulated and remotely sensed products. The strategies presented here are based on global data sets and robust statistical techniques that can be utilized in different settings with other DHMs, and thus, they provide valuable support for the scientific community focused on hyperresolution hydrologic modeling.},

A consistent approach was used to provide terrain, soil, vegetation, and meteorological data to each model—hydrological modeling system (HEC-HMS), and triangulated irregular network (TIN)–based real-time integrated basin simulator (tRIBS)—and to test the models with streamflow and water level observations. Simulation analyses focus on the differential ability of the two models in capturing precipitation and watershed properties and its effects on the hydrologic response in the presence of hydraulic infrastructure options. A scenario with a single, large dam reduced the flood peak more favorably than three smaller structures.

The last few years have begun to bear fruit from the seeds sown by these calls, through increases in the availability and utility of remote sensing data, as well as the execution of campaigns in research catchments aimed at providing new data for advancing hydrological understanding and predictive capability. In this paper we discuss some philosophical considerations related to model complexity, data availability and predictive performance, highlighting the potential of observed patterns in moving the science and practice of catchment hydrology forward. We then review advances that have arisen from recent work on spatial patterns, including in the characterisation of spatial structure and heterogeneity, and the use of patterns for developing, calibrating and testing distributed hydrological models. We illustrate progress via examples using observed patterns of snow cover, runoff occurrence and soil moisture. Methods for the comparison of patterns are presented, illustrating how they can be used to assess hydrologically important characteristics of model performance. These methods include point-to-point comparisons, spatial relationships between errors and landscape parameters, transects, and optimal local alignment. It is argued that the progress made to date augers well for future developments, but there is scope for improvements in several areas. These include better quantitative methods for pattern comparisons, better use of pattern information in data assimilation and modelling, and a call for improved archiving of data from field studies to assist in comparative studies for generalising results and developing fundamental understanding.},

	abstract = {Channel transmission losses alter the streamflow response of arid and semiarid watersheds and promote focused groundwater recharge. This process has been primarily studied in dryland channels draining large areas that are displaced away from hillslope runoff generation. In contrast, small watersheds on arid piedmont slopes allow the investigation of interactive hillslope and channel processes that control the partitioning between surface and subsurface flows. In this study, we utilize high-resolution, long-term measurements of water balance components in an instrumented watershed of the Chihuahuan Desert to set up, parameterize, and test a process-based, distributed hydrologic model modified to account for channel losses. A transient method for capturing capillary effects in channels results in simulations with a reliable representation of the watershed energy balance, soil moisture dynamics, hillslope infiltration, channel transmission (or percolation) losses, and streamflow yield over the study period. The simulation also reproduces a conceptual model of hillslope infiltration-excess runoff generation linked to downstream channel percolation losses that depend on the rainfall event size. Model-derived thresholds were obtained for the amount of hillslope runoff (6 mm) and rainfall (12.5 mm) necessary for streamflow yield, such that 40\% of percolation occurs for small events that do not reach the outlet. Using a set of scenarios, we identify that hillslope infiltration controls the rainfall threshold necessary to initiate percolation, while channel infiltration affects the partitioning into percolation and streamflow yield. Thus, the connectivity along hillslope-channel pathways is deemed an essential control on the streamflow generation and groundwater recharge in arid regions with complex terrain.},

A key feature of this parallel formulation is that it is able to achieve a high degree of concurrency while maintaining the high quality of the partitions produced by the serial multilevel k-way partitioning algorithm. In particular, the time taken by our parallel graph partitioning algorithm is only slightly longer than the time taken for re-arrangement of the graph among processors according to the new partition. Experiments with a variety of finite element graphs show that our parallel formulation produces high-quality partitionings in a short amount of time. For example, a 128-way partitioning of graphs with one million vertices can be computed in a little over two seconds on a 128-processor Cray T3D. Furthermore, the quality of the partitions produced is comparable (edge-cuts within 5\%) to those produced by the serial multilevel k-way algorithm. Thus our parallel algorithm makes it feasible to perform frequent repartitioning of graphs in dynamic computations without compromising the partitioning quality.},

	abstract = {Global changes, including climate and land use changes, can result in significant impact to water resources. Planning for these changes requires making projections, even in the face of considerable uncertainties, to make informed management and policy decisions. A number of climate change scenarios and projections at global and regional levels are available that can be used to predict the likely range of outcomes. However, there is a need to translate these projections into potential implications for hydrology and water quality. Since there are dozens of hydrologic models, there is a need to evaluate them critically and to develop guidance regarding selecting the appropriate model for a given objective. We conducted a review of 21 different models commonly used for modeling hydrology (8), water quality (6) or both (7) at the watershed scale. Six of the models are strictly water quality models that depend on a separate model or observed data for hydrology. Seven additional models are useful for estimating hydrology and water quality simultaneously. The models were then evaluated based on ten different criteria, including functionality, scope, ability to model extreme events, data requirements, availability, and technical support, among others. The models were ranked Low, Medium or High in each of the criteria. The results indicate that three hydrologic models, MIKE-SHE, HEC-HMS, and MODHMS, as well as two full hydrology and water quality models, SWAT and WARMF, stand out in terms of functionality, availability, applicability to a wide range of watersheds and scales, ease of implementation, and availability of support. Modelers should carefully select the best model for their application, in part guided by the criteria discussed herein.},

In this study, we present the parallel model implementation and real-world hydrologic assessment of the Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN)-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS). Our parallelization approach is based on the decomposition of a complex watershed using the channel network as a directed graph. The resulting sub-basin partitioning divides effort among processors and handles hydrologic exchanges across boundaries. Through numerical experiments in a set of nested basins, we quantify parallel performance relative to serial runs for a range of processors, simulation complexities and lengths, and sub-basin partitioning methods, while accounting for inter-run variability on a parallel computing system. In contrast to serial simulations, the parallel model speed-up depends on the variability of hydrologic processes. Load balancing significantly improves parallel speed-up with proportionally faster runs as simulation complexity (domain resolution and channel network extent) increases. The best strategy for large river basins is to combine a balanced partitioning with an extended channel network, with potential savings through a lower TIN resolution. Based on these advances, a wider range of applications for fully-distributed hydrologic models are now possible. This is illustrated through a set of ensemble forecasts that account for precipitation uncertainty derived from a statistical downscaling model.},

The resampling of high-resolution grid data required to effectively use distributed models, however, can result in the distortion of terrain and hydrographic properties. In this study, we present a geographic information system approach for deriving multiple resolution meshes that conserve physiographic features while significantly reducing the number of computational nodes in a distributed hydrologic model. We utilize triangulated irregular networks (TINs) which serve to integrate information on the surface topography, hydrographic features and land surface characteristics into an adaptive representation of a basin. We discuss three approaches for constructing TIN models for hydrologic applications: (1) Traditional, (2) hydrographic and (3) hydrological similarity TINs. We focus on the generation of triangulated terrain models using the concept of hydrological similarity provided through a topographic or wetness index. This new method embeds an estimate of the steady-state hydrologic response directly into the basin terrain model. Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate the advantages of the multiple resolution approaches over a range of terrain characteristics, basin scales and elevation data products. Finally, we discuss the implications of TIN terrain representation for watershed simulation with the TIN-based Real-Time Integrated Basin Simulator model.},

	abstract = {Monitoring Earth's terrestrial water conditions is critically important to many hydrological applications such as global food production; assessing water resources sustainability; and flood, drought, and climate change prediction. These needs have motivated the development of pilot monitoring and prediction systems for terrestrial hydrologic and vegetative states, but to date only at the rather coarse spatial resolutions (∼10–100 km) over continental to global domains. Adequately addressing critical water cycle science questions and applications requires systems that are implemented globally at much higher resolutions, on the order of 1 km, resolutions referred to as hyperresolution in the context of global land surface models. This opinion paper sets forth the needs and benefits for a system that would monitor and predict the Earth's terrestrial water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. We discuss six major challenges in developing a system: improved representation of surface-subsurface interactions due to fine-scale topography and vegetation; improved representation of land-atmospheric interactions and resulting spatial information on soil moisture and evapotranspiration; inclusion of water quality as part of the biogeochemical cycle; representation of human impacts from water management; utilizing massively parallel computer systems and recent computational advances in solving hyperresolution models that will have up to 109 unknowns; and developing the required in situ and remote sensing global data sets. We deem the development of a global hyperresolution model for monitoring the terrestrial water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles a “grand challenge” to the community, and we call upon the international hydrologic community and the hydrological science support infrastructure to endorse the effort.},

Nevertheless, relatively little is known on the catchment response in the NAM region because of the paucity of observations. Numerical watershed models, tested against field and remote sensing data, can aid in identifying catchment hydrologic patterns and the controls exerted by climate, soil, vegetation, and terrain properties. In this study, we utilize a distributed hydrologic model to explore the soil moisture and evapotranspiration distributions in a semiarid mountain basin. Results indicate a reliable and consistent model performance at the point and catchment scales for a set of tested hydrologic states and fluxes. Distributed model simulations reveal that soil, vegetation, and terrain controls on catchment spatial patterns vary according to the wetness state in a manner similar to that found across a wider range of climate conditions. Spatiotemporal variations in soil moisture and evapotranspiration exhibit hysteresis as an emergent pattern induced by climate variability and the underlying hydrologic interactions in the catchment.},

This study investigates the transient runoff response to spatially-uniform storms of varying properties using a distributed model of the coupled surface-subsurface system, which treats heterogeneities in topography, soils and vegetation. We demonstrate the control that the partitioning into multiple runoff mechanisms (infiltration-excess, saturation-excess, perched return flow and groundwater exfiltration) has on nonlinearities in the rainfall-runoff transformation and its scale-dependence. Antecedent wetness imposed through a distributed water table position is varied to illustrate its effect on runoff generation. Results indicate that transitions observed in basin flood response and its nonlinear and scale-dependent behavior can be explained by shifts in the surface-subsurface partitioning. An analysis of the spatial organization of runoff production also shows that multiple mechanisms have specific catchment niches and can occur simultaneously in the basin. In addition, catchment scale plays an important role in the distribution of runoff production as basin characteristics (soils, vegetation, topography and initial wetness) are varied with basin area. For example, we illustrate how storm characteristics and antecedent wetness play an important role in the scaling properties of the catchment runoff ratio.},
